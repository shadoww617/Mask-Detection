# 😷 Smart Face Mask Detection System  
Real-time multi-person face-mask compliance detection using **YOLO** and **Streamlit**, designed for smart surveillance in public environments like airports, malls, stations, and offices.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project detects whether people are:
- ✔ Wearing mask correctly  
- ❌ Not wearing a mask  
- ⚠ Wearing a mask incorrectly  

It supports **multiple face detection in a single frame** and works on images with clear bounding boxes and readable labels.

---

## 🧠 Model
- Architecture: **YOLO (Ultralytics) – Lightweight Detection Model**
- Trained on: **Kaggle Face Mask Detection Dataset**
- Classes:
  - `with_mask`
  - `without_mask`
  - `mask_weared_incorrect`
- Input size: `416x416`
- Performance:
  - **mAP@0.5:** ~0.74  
  - Best performance on `with_mask`
  - Reasonable performance on crowded scenes and multiple persons

Pretrained weights included:
runs/detect/mask_detector2/weights/best.pt
